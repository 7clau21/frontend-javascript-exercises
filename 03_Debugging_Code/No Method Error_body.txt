This is the easiest error to diagnose, but it's still worth practicing because it's important to see what the errors look like in the context of RSpec.

Don't type anything - just hit "Run". You should see something that looks like:

```bash
NoMethodError: undefined method `hello' for main:Object
```

This means that RSpec tried to run invoke the `hello` method but it couldn't find the method definition (because we haven't defined it yet).

Now that you've seen the error, read the test and write a method to make it pass.
