Write a method named `favorite_number`, which should take two arguments:

```ruby
def favorite_number(a,b)
end
```

The first argument should represent a favorite number and the second should represent a guess of what that number is. To make our method more readable, let's rename our arguments:

```ruby
def favorite_number(fav,guess)
end
```

> Arguments can be named anything, but using well named arguments (as well as methods, variables, etc.) is important in writing readable code.

The `favorite_number` method should:

* return `"Too high"` if `guess` is greater than `fav`
* return `"Too low"` if `guess` is less than `fav`
* return `"You got it!"` if `guess` is equal to `fav`
