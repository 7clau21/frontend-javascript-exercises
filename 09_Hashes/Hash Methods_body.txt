This exercise will help you get familiar with some of the common `Hash` methods that Ruby provides.

Create a method named `merge_us` that expects two arguments and combines them, assuming they're hashes. The `Hash` class has a method named `merge` that will be helpful to you.

Create a method named `my_keys` that takes an argument and returns an `Array` of keys. The `Hash` class has a method named `keys` that will be helpful to you.

Create a method named `do_i_have?` which expects two arguments. The arguments should represent a `Hash` and `Array` of keys. `do_i_have?` should return `true` if the `Array` has **all** of the keys in the hash, and `false` if it does not. To create this method, you could start with something like this:

```ruby
def do_i_have?(hash, array_of_keys)
end
```

You want to make sure that every key in the `hash` argument is also contained in the `array_of_keys` argument. (Remember that `hash` is expected to be `Hash` and `array_of_keys` is expected to be an `Array`). To compare two objects for equality, you need them to be evaluated as the same object **type**. That is, you can't explicitly compare a `Hash` to an `Array`, but you can compare an `Array` to an `Array`. The first thing you can do is to return an array of `keys` from the `hash` argument:

```ruby
def do_i_have?(hash, array_of_keys)
  hash.keys #=> returns an array of keys
end
```

We can now easily compare two arrays - the array returned from `hash.keys` and the `array_of_keys` array that was passed as an argument:

```ruby
def do_i_have?(hash, array_of_keys)
  hash.keys == array_of_keys
end
```

This is an improvement, but unfortunately it won't satisfy all of the specs. Our method should return `true` if all of the elements in the `array_of_keys` array match the keys in the `hash` argument, without regard to a specific order. Our comparison above compares the two arrays **with** regard to order. Try using the `sort` method provided by Ruby to order both arrays in the same fashion. Once they are ordered the same, you can do a simple comparison to determine equality.

> It's always a good idea to read through the [Ruby Docs](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Hash.html) and learn about all of the methods that Ruby provides for the `Hash` class.
