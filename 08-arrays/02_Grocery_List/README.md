In this exercise we'll create a program that allows you to manage a grocery list. You'll need to create two functions for this program, each of which is detailed below.

- Create an **addItem** function. This function should take two arguments:
    - the first argument is the item you want to add to the list
    - the second argument is the array that the item will be added to. 
    - Don't add an item to the list if it already exists in the list

- Create a **reverseSortedList** function. This function should take a list of items and return the list, sorted alphabetically.
